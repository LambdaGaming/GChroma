# About
 GChroma is a link between Garry's Mod and the Razer Chroma SDK. It allows developers to integrate Chroma support into their addons through Lua. The module is available for Windows x86 and Windows x64. The Lua documentation can be found [here.](https://github.com/LambdaGaming/GChroma/blob/main/doc.md)

# Note
 This module is still in early development, so expect bugs, crashes, performance issues, all that jazz.

# Note to Developers
 When adding support to your addon, make sure it doesn't interfere with other addons. GChroma currently has no way of knowing what addon is supposed to take priority.

# FAQs
 ## Does this work on servers?
 Yes, but the server needs to have the base addon for it to work on your end.

 ## Is support for Linux/Mac planned?
 Currently, no. This is partly due to Razer Synapse only natively supporting Windows.

 ## Does this work on beta branches of the game?
 It works on the x86-64 branch. Other branches haven't been tested.
